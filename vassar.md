## Hey, Vassar!

**Need an online portfolio? A professional home base to represent you on the web that's *not* Facebook?**

Something like `http://yourname.com`?

You're in luck! I can help you with that.

I've been building websites for several years now, and I particularly enjoy working on personal websites. I can set you up with a website to present your artistic portfolio, host pictures, stream video and audio, display your resume, or list your services. It can even be a simple landing page pointing visitors to your portfolio or profiles on places like Bandcamp, Youtube, or Tumblr.

What you'll get from a custom built site by me:

1. A speedy, search engine optimized site (so that Google will list your site first, before social media).
2. I'll register and set up your domain name for you.
3. Create an aesthetic that represents *you*.
4. A mobile responsive design, so your site is as clear and clean on your desktop as it is on your phone. (If you're reading this on a desktop computer, resize your window to see what I mean.)
5. Affordable plans for future changes and requests to your site!

If you're interested or curious about my rates, shoot me a message! Let me know what you need and we'll come up with a practical and affordable way to make it work.
