## Oh, hey!

{% image rogin-avatar.jpg alt="Logo" id="rogin" class="alignright" %}

I'm Rogin Farrer and I'm a theatrical designer and pixel-pusher based in the Greater Boston area. I was born and raised just west of Boston.

<p>I drink my coffee black, constantly listen to podcasts and <a id="soundcloud" href="https://soundcloud.com/rogin-farrer">new</a> <a id="spotify" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1212116974">music</a>, and believe great design incorporates all elements of the production working together as a unified whole. I&rsquo;m a big fan of art, literature, and philosophy, and appreciate the ways they intertwine together and with performance.</p>

This spring I will graduate from Vassar College with a B.A. in Drama, and afterwards I will begin working for the [Gloucester Stage Company](http://gloucesterstage.com) as their Scenic Design/Carpentry Apprentice.

Between my studies and production work, I design and develop websites. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and Wordpress for years, and am becoming increasingly fluent in Javascript, PHP, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and mobile responsive practices. I have a soft spot for typography.
