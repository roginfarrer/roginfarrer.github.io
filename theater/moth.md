<h2>Creating a liminal space</h2>

<p>MOTH was the first production the Collaborative (GSC's apprentice ensemble) tackled. Our objective and challenge was to capture the purgatory that Claryssa and Sebastian find themselves reliving again and again.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>As the first production our ensemble took on, it was the first time we worked together. One of the largest hurdles was learning to quickly trust each other as artists. We all came to this program with diverse backgrounds and histories in the creative and collaborative process. Our decision to forego a singular director in favor of group direction escalted this challenge.</p>

<p>Another challenge for us was the obstacle that was "The New Electric Ballroom" set that was in performance for GSC's MainStage season. We were limited in space and scope, as after our run, we had to strike to be ready for a show the next day. For my lighting, I was limited to the plot hung for the show. I had only the freedom to change the colors of the instruments and to add practicals, which I could control from table-top dimmers I could set up in the booth.</p>

<p>Finally, time was not on my side for this production. In addition to being the lighting designer, I also stage managed rehearsals and built the set in the weeks leading up to the production. We loaded into the space Sunday evening to tech for a Monday evening performance. I was forced to design quickly, as I was not only responsible for readying my design, but also ensuring the entire production was ready for the next evening.</p>
